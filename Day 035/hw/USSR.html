    <p>On November 28, 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, there was a Transcaucasian Commissariat established in Tiflis.
         On April 22 the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was formed, though it only lasted for a month before being replaced
          by three new states: the Georgian Democratic Republic, the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.
           The 1919 parliamentary elections saw the Social Democratic Party come to power in Georgia. It tried to establish a moderate left,
            multi-party system, but faced some internal and external problems. Georgia was dragged into wars against Armenia and remnants of
             the Ottoman Empire, while the rapid spread of ideas of revolutionary socialism in rural regions accounted for some Soviet-backed
              peasants' revolts in Racha, Samegrelo and Dusheti. In 1921, the crisis came to a head. The 11th Red Army invaded Georgia
               from the south and headed to Tbilisi. On 25 February, after a one-week offence by the Red Army, Tbilisi fell to the Bolsheviks.[3]
                Georgian Bolsheviks took over the country and proclaimed the establishment of the Georgian SSR. Some small-scale battles
                 between Bolshevik troops and Georgian Army also took place in Western Georgia. In March 1921 the government of the Georgian
                  Democratic Republic was forced in exile. On March 2 of the following year the first constitution of Soviet Georgia
                   was accepted.</p>
    <p>On 13 October 1921 the Treaty of Kars was signed, which established the common borders between Turkey and the three Transcaucasian
         republics of the Soviet Union. Georgian SSR was forced to cede Georgian-dominated Artvin Okrug to Turkey in exchange for Adjara,
          which was granted political autonomy within Georgian SSR under Soviet rule.</p>
    <p>Reaching the Caucasus oilfields was one of the main objectives of Adolf Hitler's invasion of the USSR in June 1941,
         but the armies of the Axis powers never reached as far as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters
          (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. During this period Joseph Stalin
          , an ethnic Georgian, ordered the deportation of the Chechen, German, Ingush, Karachay, Karapapaks, Meskhetian Turks and
           Balkarian peoples from the Caucasus; they were transported to Siberia and Central Asia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis.
            He also abolished their respective autonomous republics. The Georgian SSR was briefly granted some of their
             territory until 1957.[5]</p>
    <p>On March 9, 1956, about a hundred Georgian students were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev's
         policy of de-Stalinization that was accompanied by an offhanded remark he made about Georgians at the end
          of his anti-Stalin speech.</p>
    <p>The decentralisation program introduced by Khrushchev in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian Communist Party officials
         to build their own regional power base. A thriving pseudo-capitalist shadow economy emerged alongside the official
          state-owned economy. While the official growth rate of the economy of the Georgia was among the lowest in the USSR,
           such indicators as savings level, rates of car and house ownership were the highest in the Union,[6] making
            Georgia one of the most economically successful Soviet republics. Among all the union republics, Georgia had
             the highest number of residents with high or special secondary education.[7]</p>
    <p>Although corruption was hardly unknown in the Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that it
         came to be an embarrassment to the authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's interior minister
          between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze,
           the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary
            with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the officia
            l economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials.</p>
