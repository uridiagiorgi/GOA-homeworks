    <p>Pharnavaz I[a] (/fɑːrnɑːvɑːz/; Georgian: ფარნავაზ I, romanized: parnavaz I Georgian pronunciation: [pʰaɾnavaz]) was a king
         (mepe) of Kartli, an ancient Georgian kingdom known as Iberia in classical antiquity. The Georgian Chronicles credits him
          with being the first monarch founding the kingship of Kartli and the Pharnavazid dynasty, while other independent chronicles,
           such as The Conversion of Kartli make him the second Georgian monarch. Based on the medieval evidence, most scholars locate Pharnavaz's
            rule in the 3rd century BC: 302–237 BC according to Prince Vakhushti of Kartli, 299–234 BC according to Cyril Toumanoff and 284–219 B
             according to Pavle Ingoroqva.[5] Pharnavaz's rise, advent and imperial expansion of the Iberian monarchy was directly tied
              to the victory of Alexander the Great over the Achaemenid Empire.[6][7] Pharnavaz ruled under th
              e suzerainty of the Seleucid Empire.[8]</p>
    <p>Pharnavaz had introduced a military-administrative organization based on a network of regional governors or eristavi.
        [29] The insignia of the eristavi, received from the king, constituted a sceptre, a special signet ring, belt and armament.
        [30] Iberia had in total seven eristavis, in Colchis,[31] Kakheti,[32] Khunani[33] (modern-day northern Azerbaijan),
         Samshvilde[34] (Kvemo Kartli), Tsunda[35] (included Javakheti, Kola and Artaani), Odzrkhe[36] and Klarjeti.[37]
          The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the direct control of the royal power based in Inner Kartli.[38]
           Eristavates mimicked aspects of Achaemenid satrapies and Seleucid strategoi. The major motive of later historian of th
           e chronicles was to convince posterity that the basic political structure of Kartli was created by the very first Georgian
            monarch in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid administrative system and had remained stable throughout
             Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times. In this way, the long-term viability and stability of the Georgian realm
              are established.[39]</p>
    <p>The hierarchic structure created by Pharnavaz was the following: king; commander-in-chief (spaspet) of the royal army;
         eristavis; middle commanders (atasistavis tsikhistavis) of the garrisons stationed in the royal strongholds;
          junior commanders (asistavis) who were the younger sons of the aristocratic families; mercenary professional warriors from the
           neighboring countries and all the soldiers organized around the entire kingdom.[40]</p>
