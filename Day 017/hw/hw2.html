    <p>According to one account King Vakhtang Gorgasali (r. 447-502) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon.</p> 
    <p>The king's falcon caught a pheasant, but both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died.  King Vakhtang was so impressed with</p> 
    <p>the discovery that he decided to build a city on this location. The name Tbilisi derives from the Old Georgian word "Tpili",</p> 
    <p>meaning warm. The name Tbili or Tbilisi ("warm location") therefore was given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric </p> 
    <p>hot springs, which are still heavily exploited, notably for public baths, in the Abanotubani district. This mythical foundation </p> 
    <p> This mythical foundation account is still popular, but archaeological evidence shows that Vakhtang revived, or rebuilt parts</p> 
    <p>of the city (such as Abanotubani, or the Metekhi palace, where his statue now stands) but did not found it.</p> <br>
