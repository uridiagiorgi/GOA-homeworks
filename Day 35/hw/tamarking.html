    <p>Tamar was born in circa 1160 to George III, King of Georgia, and his consort Burdukhan, a daughter of the king of Alania.
     While it is possible that Tamar had a younger sister, Rusudan, she is only mentioned once in all contemporary accounts of Tamar's reign.
     The name Tamar is of Hebrew origin and, like other biblical names, was favored by the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty because of their claim
     to be descended from David, the second king of Israel.</p> <br>
    <p>Tamar's youth coincided with a major upheaval in Georgia; in 1177, her father, George III, was confronted by a rebellious faction of nobles.
    The rebels intended to dethrone George in favor of the king's fraternal nephew, Demna,
    who was considered by many to be a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father, David V. Demna's cause was little but a pretext for the nobles,
    led by the pretender's father-in-law, the amirspasalar ("high constable") Ivane II Orbeli, to weaken the crown.
    George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans;
    Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. Demna, castrated and blinded on his uncle's
    order, did not survive the mutilation and soon died in prison.[10] Once the rebellion was suppressed and the pretender eliminated,
    George went ahead to co-opt Tamar into government with him and crowned her as co-ruler in 1178.
    By doing so, the king attempted to preempt any dispute after his death and legitimize his line on the throne of Georgia.
    At the same time, he raised men from the Kipchaks as well as from the gentry and unranked classes to keep the dynastic aristocracy away
    from the center of power.[12]</p> <br>
    <p>
        For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler with her father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar continued as the sole monarch and
         was crowned a second time at the Gelati cathedral near Kutaisi, western Georgia. She inherited a relatively strong kingdom,
          but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles were far from being quelled. There was considerable opposition to Tamar's
           succession; this was sparked by a reaction against the repressive policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other
            perceived weakness, her sex.
            As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, a part of the aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy
            , while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves.[11] The energetic involvement
             of Tamar's influential aunt Rusudan and the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne.
             [13] However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy.
              She had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the
               clerical and secular hierarchies.
