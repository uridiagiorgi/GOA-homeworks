    <p>David IV, also known as David IV the Builder[1] (Georgian: დავით IV აღმაშენებელი, romanized: davit IV aghmashenebeli) (1073–1125),
         of the Bagrationi dynasty, was the 5th king (mepe) of the Kingdom of Georgia from 1089 until his death in 1125.[2]</p>
    <p>Popularly considered to be the greatest and most successful Georgian ruler in history and an original architect of the Georgian Golden Age,
         he succeeded in driving the Seljuk Turks out of the country, winning the Battle of Didgori in 1121.
          His reforms of the army and administration enabled him to reunite the country and bring most of the lands of the Caucasus under Georgia's
           control. A friend of the Church and a notable promoter of Christian culture, he was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church.</p>
    <p>The epithet aghmashenebeli (აღმაშენებელი), which is translated as "the Builder" (in the sense of "built completely"),
         "the Rebuilder",[3] or "the Restorer",[4][5] first appears as the sobriquet of David in the charter issued in the name of
          "King of Kings Bagrat" in 1452 and becomes firmly affixed to him in the works of the 17th- and 18th-century historians such as
           Parsadan Gorgijanidze, Beri Egnatashvili and Prince Vakhushti.[6] Epigraphic data also provide evidence for the early use of
            David's other epithet, "the Great" (დიდი, didi).</p>
    <p>David grew up in times of war and desolation, due to the ravages of the Seljuks and his father's numerous defeats against these invaders.
         Faced with such a situation, significant opposition arose against King George II and led to a change of power for the benefit
          of young David; George of Chqondidi would have been one of these opponents.[20]</p>
    <p>The Life of King of Kings David does not recount the details of the transfer of power between George II and his son.
         Nodar Asatiani describes the event as a “palace revolution” involving several dignitaries in 1089.[20] Other historians speak
          rather of pressure on the Georgian king with a view to his abdication instead of a coup d'état.[21] The contemporary chronicler
           of David IV limits himself to mentioning the change of power as a coronation of the young prince by his father,[22] which pushes
            certain historians like Cyril Toumanoff to suggest a co-reign between George II and David IV, at least until 1112,[23] while
             frescoes found in the Ateni Sioni Church represent him in monk's clothing, which would mean that his abdication was forced.[24]
              The historical tradition founded by Prince Vakhushti in the 18th century and followed by Marie-Félicité Brosset in the 19th states that
               David succeeded George upon his death, a number of surviving documents suggest that George died around 1112, and that although
                he retained the royal title until his death,[25][26][22] he played no significant political role, real power having passed on to
                 David.[26] Moreover, David himself had been a co-ruler with his father sometime before his becoming a king-regant in 1089;
                  a document of 1085 mentions David as "king and sebastos", the latter being a Byzantine title.[25]</p>
